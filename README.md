Takes an AFM image from a txt file and converts in into a dxf file which can be used in CAD programs.
Each scan line is saved under a seperate layer in the dxf file.

Requires manually exporting AFM .ibw files into .txt files (e.g. using gwyddion)
so if someone can directly use .ibw in python feel free to add.
